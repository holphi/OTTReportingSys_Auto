|Step2            |On the pop up new event window, click '''Select Transform''' button.        |
|Step3            |On the pop up Select Tranform window, check off transform selected previously,check on a new transform        |
|Step4            |Click on '''OK''' on select transform window.                                                             |
|Expected Result1 |Verify only new transform selected in step3 display in transform list.                                                                                                                     |

|Expected Result3 |Verify data base which is trasformed to has no relative records before event triggered.                                                                                                                     |
|Expected Result4 |Verify date base which is transformed to has exactly the same number of records with the transform selected in step3 |
|Expected Result5 |Verify it has relative log on log viewer page(including update event and generate event).                                                                         |

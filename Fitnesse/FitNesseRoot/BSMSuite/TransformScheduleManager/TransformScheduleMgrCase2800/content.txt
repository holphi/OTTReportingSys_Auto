|Step2            |In Time period first box, select another time which is later than current BSM server system clock.                                                                     |

|Expected Result2|Verify data base which is trasformed to has no relative records before event triggered.                                                                                                                     |
|Expected Result3 |Verify date base which is transformed to has exactly the same number of records with the transform selected in step3 |
|Expected Result4 |Verify it has relative log on log viewer page(including update event and generate event).                                                                         |

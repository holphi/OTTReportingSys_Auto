|Precondition1    |Create an event "event 4300a" on Report Schedule Manager page.!See .BsmSuite.ScheduleManagerSuite.ScheduleMgrCase0100.Create an event "event 4300b" on Transform Schedule Manager page.!See .BsmSuite.TransformScheduleManager.TransformScheduleMgrCase0100    |
|Precondition2    |Make sure "event 4300a" and "event 4300b" choose the same time to generate.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|Step1            |Set BSM server time to trigger "event 4300a" and "event 4300b".                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|Expected Result1 |Verify "event 4300a" generate a report successfully and report is sent to email successfully.|
|Expected Result2 |Verify "event 4300b" generate a transform successfully                                                                        |

|Expected Result4 |Verify every 1 day at time input in step10 "event4100a" generate transform.|
|Expected Result5 |verify every Friday at time input in step23 "event4100b" generate transform|
|Expected Result4 |Verify DB which is transformed to has no relative records before event is triggered.                                                                                                                    |
|Expected Result5 |Verify DB which is transformed to has exactly the same records with transform selected|
|Expected Result6 |Verify it has relative records on log viewer page.|
